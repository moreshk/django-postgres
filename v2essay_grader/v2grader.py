        5-6 Points: Punctuation is used skillfully and accurately throughout the writing, significantly aiding the reader's understanding.

        Grade 7 and Grade 9 criteria:
        1-2 Points: The student uses a mix of basic and advanced punctuation with some errors.
        3-4 Points: The student accurately uses a wide range of punctuation, including more advanced forms, with few mistakes and for stylistic effect.
        5-6 Points: Punctuation is used expertly and accurately throughout the writing, not just for clarity but also for stylistic and rhetorical effect.

        Keep in mind the students grade and the essay type. Grade 3 and 5 have the same criteria, Grade 7 and Grade 9 have the same criteria. 
        Be more lenient to the lower grades. So the same essay would score higher if written by a grade 3 vs for grade 5 even if the criteria was same. Same for grade 7 vs grade 9.
        Provide feedback on the input essay in terms of what if anything was done well and what can be improved. Try to include examples. 
        
        Keep your response limited to less than 5 sentences and format your response as Feedback: (your feedback) Grade: (your grade)/(Scored out of).

        Remember the max score for persuasive essay type is 6 and narrative essay type is 5. Hence scored out of for persuasive will be 5 and for narrative will be 5.
