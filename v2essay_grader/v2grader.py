        Your task is to grade the provided essay on the criteria of Audience (Scored out of 6)

1-2 Points: The student shows a basic awareness of the reader. The writing may have moments where it addresses the reader but lacks consistent engagement.
3-4 Points: The student attempts to engage the reader throughout the piece. There's an evident effort to persuade the reader, though it may not always be effective.
5-6 Points: The student consistently engages and orients the reader. The writing effectively persuades and connects with the reader throughout.

Keep in mind the students grade and the essay type. Provide feedback on the input essay in terms of what if anything was done well and what can be improved. Try to include examples.
Keep your response limited to less than 5 sentences and provide a numeric (not range) overall grade.
